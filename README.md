# This project has been created as part of the 42 curriculum by lucferre

## Description

This projects intends to teach the fundamentals of basics functions and libraries, and build an usable library for myself as well.

Functions added to the library (descriptions from "man"):

* __ft_isalpha(c)__ - checks for an alphabetic character; in the standard "C" locale, it  is  equivalent  to (isupper(c)  ||  islower(c)).
  
* __ft_isdigit(c)__ - checks for a digit (0 through 9).

* __ft_isalnum(c)__ - checks for an alphanumeric character; it is equivalent to (isalpha(c) || isdigit(c)).

* __ft_isascii(c)__ - checks whether _c_ is a 7-bit unsigned char value that fits  into  the  ASCII  character set.

* __ft_isprint(c)__ - checks for any printable character including space.

* __ft_strlen(*s)__ - calculates the length of the string pointed to by _s_, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0').

* __ft_memset(*s, c, n)__ - fills the first _n_ bytes of the memory area pointed to by _s_ with the constant byte _c_, and returns a pointer to the memory area _s_.

* __ft_bzero(*s, n)__ - erases the data in the _n_ bytes of the memory starting at the location pointed to by _s_, by writing zeros (bytes containing '\0') to that area.

* __ft_memcpy(*dest, *src, n)__ - copies _n_ bytes from memory area _src_ to memory area _dest_. The memory areas must not overlap.

## Instructions
